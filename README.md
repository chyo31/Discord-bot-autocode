# replit discord bot rinznity 
# Here my personal open source bot.

# my prefix : +

# List of commands? :
# +msg (your message) will always mention the @member role tag and 3 will delete your original message, make sure you have the admin role.
# +status (play/listen/watch/stream) make sure you have an admin role before using this command
# +help (do rewrite on help menu)

# Features: automatic update of activity status: PLAYING, LISTENING, WATCHING, STREAMING (a small note: if you want to customize the status with the +status command, it will automatically be replaced with the automatic feature status, so you can delete one of them, So if your discord bot is public then you must delete the command +status section.
# And you can also add auto refresh JavaScript html code to your personal website that supports the main JavaScript.
